A game made using the Sphere game engine.

Known Bugs:

Stuff TODO (in order):
    Add a battle system
        Enemies
    Add a "you died" screen

    Add a backpack
    Add bank system

    Add a questing system
    
    Make shops functional

    Add a title screen
    Add networking (login, levels, etc)
    Add functional chat system
    See if I can add scrolling on panels
    Add multiplayer
        Multiple people on the map
        Friends list
        Ignore list

    Make a website for the game
    Add a registration/sign-up form (might end up just being a web-page)

Stuff TODO (misc.):
    Add spritesets for different player classes & genders
    Figure out how to make the game modular, so new features can easily be added
    Add skills, and how to level them/how they affect the game
    Come up with a name for the game
    Figure out how magic is going to work
    Figure out if I can make the game open-source and still make money (figure out how much I should open-source)
    Add a right-click meny for items
    Add picking items up (possibly using the mouse, similar to RS. However, this would possibly require pathing and clicking to move...)
