A game made using the Sphere game engine.

Known Bugs:
    Removing popups 1 at a time. Can only remove them all together? (Refer to functions.js)

Stuff TODO (in order):
    Add a battle system
        Enemies
    Add a "you died" screen

    Add bank system

    Add a questing system
    
    Make shops functional

    Add a title screen
    Add networking (login, levels, etc)
    Add functional chat system
    Add multiplayer
        Multiple people on the map
        Friends list
        Ignore list

    Make a website for the game
    Add a registration/sign-up form (might end up just being a web-page)

Stuff TODO (misc.):
    Write something based on getStringWidth that takes into account \n and only calculates the width of the longest line
    Add styling to text (similar to HTML)
    Add a screenPercent() function. Where screenPercent(x, 50) would return an int for 50% of the screens width
    Add scrolling to panels.
    Figure out how to give callbacks params. May possibly be able to do something like funcName(addParams()); where addParams is a for loop.
    Add spritesets for different player classes & genders
    Figure out how to make the game modular, so new features can easily be added
    Figure out how stats are leveled
    Add skills, and how to level them/how they affect the game
    Come up with a name for the game
    Figure out how magic is going to work
    Figure out if I can make the game open-source and still make money (figure out how much I should open-source)
    Add a right-click meny for items
    Add picking items up (possibly using the mouse, similar to RS. However, this would possibly require pathing and clicking to move...)
